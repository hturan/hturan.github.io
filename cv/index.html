        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm a developer that loves to work creatively. My strengths lie in working closely with designers to implement pixel-perfect user experiences. I have experience developing and designing for both web and native platforms, alongside back-end API and database work.</p>

        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <h3>Journl <span class="job_title">Web Developer</span> <span class="dates">February 2013 - Present</span></h3>
        <p>As part of a small development team, we built an intricate and comprehensive life organisation tool consisting of calendars, to-dos, lists, notes and file storage, on both the web and iOS. Doing so allowed me to build on a huge number of skills; everything from managing AWS EC2 instances to prototyping feature ideas with the latest front-end technologies. Some of my accomplishments include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Converting our <code>Rails</code> app into separate clients backed by an API</li>
          <li>Creating a <code>Node</code>-powered dynamic image server (fronted by a CDN) to handle user uploads</li>
          <li>Using <code>Gulp</code> to reduce our front-end deployment times by ~80%</li>
          <li>Planning, building and releasing Journl's iOS app using <code>Phonegap</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>My main focus as a developer was on the front-end, where I helped build and maintain our Ember-inspired custom JS framework. As one of the earlier development hires, I was able to oversee large projects shipping simultaneously across multiple platforms. I also had the oppourtunity to train new team members and lead in-depth technical discussions, which I enjoyed greatly.</p>

        <h3>Oxford Websites <span class="job_title">Founder</span> <span class="dates">October 2009 — May 2013</span></h3>
        <p>Oxford Websites was the name given to my freelance web development business. It started as an interest in web development at a young age, and developed into a full-time company with multiple clients based all over the UK. Running a business taught me many key skills, from new technical abilities (running and maintaining multiple servers) to client management and communication skills. Most of my day-to-day work involved hand coding HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, alongside web design in Photoshop.</p>

        <h3>Swellmade <span class="job_title">Founder</span> <span class="dates">August 2010 — January 2011</span></h3>
        <p>I founded a limited company to develop and release iOS software. Swellmade developed multiple prototypes and brought one app to market. Whilst the app (named ‘Reminders’, far before such functionality was part of the OS) did well and sold hundreds of copies, I didn't have the time and resources needed to compete in the ever-more-risky App Store.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Grove Street Media</h3>
        <p>Grove Street Media is a small digital studio in Summertown, Oxford that specialises in digital education software. During my month-long placement, we worked on exploring the possibilities of iOS app development. I designed and developed a novelty proof-of-concept app from the ground up.</p>

        <h3>IBM (Hursley Software Development Lab)</h3>
        <p>I participated in a week-long placement working within the CICS (Customer Information Control System) team, beginning development on an internal team wiki. This placement involved talking to members of the team and identifying key areas with which a collaborative wiki could help, followed by the planning and implementation of the wiki.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><strong>The Cherwell School (A Level)</strong> — Physics, Computing, Maths and Business Studies</p>
        <p><strong>Magdalen College School (GCSE)</strong> — 4 A*, 6 A</p>

        <blockquote>Harley is an extremely talented developer. During his two years with me he started with a broad understanding of Javascript and in a small amount of time took ownership of a custom Javascript framework, developed all of our build tools, built native apps and managed our AWS infrastructure. He is thorough, extremely hard working and motivates and influences his co-workers through his natural ability to interpret problems and clearly explain solutions.</blockquote>
